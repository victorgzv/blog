title: Accessing pixels using OpenCV
categories: [Image Processing ]
---
In this week lecture we looked at pixels.A pixel is the smallest unit of a digital image. Accessing pixels can be useful to to change the characteristics of an specific pixel or a set of pixels.

There are 5 pieces of information to identify a pixel: I, J and RGB.
The format of a pixel looks as follows: I[i,j,c]

* i is the row number and is equivalent to y
* j is thecolumn number and is equivalent to x
* c represents the colour: 0 blue, 1 green and 2 red.
(Remember RGB in opencv is BGR)

We also learned that we can apply values to a pixel in different ways.
```python
# This will maximise the intensity of the blue colour at that pixel location.
I[i,j,0]= 255

# The blue value at that location remember RGB in opencv is BGR
I[i,j] = (255,0,0) 

# The colon (:) allows us to select a range of values
#all the pixels in the rectangle 
#from (300, 100) to (400, 200)in blue.
I[100:200,300:400] = (255,0,0)

To test the skills we just adquired we were given a new task. This task consisted of capturing the user input to access the location where a user has clicked using mouse events. To do this the code below shows how to implement a mouse callback function that captures left click events.

Once the user clicks are capture we needed to draw a 201 x 201, 5-pixel thick red square around this location, to then convert the pixels within the square to YUV colour space withouth falling of the edges of the image.

You can download the image that I used for this example.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/airballoons.jpg)

```python
import cv2
import easygui
import numpy as np

def draw(event,x,y,flags,param):
    if event == cv2.EVENT_LBUTTONDOWN:
        pt1x = x-101
        pt1y = y-101
        pt2x = x+101
        pt2y = y+101
# handling when the user clicks the edges of the image
#size[1] is the width of an image
#size[0] is the height of an image
        if(x>101 and y>101 and x < size[1]-101 and y < size[0]-101 ):
            fit =original.copy() 
            # Print red square at the location selected
            cv2.rectangle(img = fit, pt1 = (pt1x,pt1y), pt2 =(pt2x,pt2y), color = (0,0,255), thickness = 5)
            #Switch seleted pixels to YUV
            YUV = cv2.cvtColor(fit, cv2.COLOR_BGR2YUV)
            fit[pt1y:pt2y,pt1x:pt2x,0]=YUV[pt1y:pt2y,pt1x:pt2x,0]

            cv2.imshow("image", fit)

cv2.namedWindow("image")
#Callback to draw function 
cv2.setMouseCallback("image", draw)
I = cv2.imread("airballoons.jpg")

size = np.shape(I) # size of the image
original = I.copy() #create a copy
cv2.imshow("image", I)
key = cv2.waitKey(0)
````
This is the output of the code above:
