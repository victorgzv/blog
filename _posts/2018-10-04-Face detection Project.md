Our Project focus on identifying region of faces in the following image.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Graduation.jpg)

The given image contains 21 people at a graduation. The solution required needs to be applicable to other similar images such as a soccer team or any other image containing multiple faces.

This week we started the project. On out first team meeting we discussed that one of our initial thoughts is to create a program that will isolate regions based on skin colour as well as research for other possible solutions.

This is an interesting research project and there seems to be lots of available resources regarding this topic. The use of face recognition systems have considerably improved in the last few years on mobile platforms and in other forms of technology.
