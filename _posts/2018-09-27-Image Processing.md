title: Simple operations on images using OpenCV
categories: [Image Processing]

My name is Victor Gonzalez and I'm a student in Computer Science DT228/4. This week, we had our first lecture in Image Processing and we set up Python and OpenCV.

As I am planning on using Image processing in my final year project Iâ€™ve started going through the lecture notes available on the college platform and tried out some tasks.

In this blog I will illustrate the progress made week by week on this module.
